# mvpictures
Move pictures based on exif data into date based subdirectories for time based management.

## How to setup
### Optional, use a virutal environment
It is best to setup a virtual environment.
```
python3 -m venv .
source bin/activate
```
In case the above will fail and you are on Ubuntu you may miss the venv module. This command will then help.
```
sudo apt-get install python3.10-venv
```
### Install dependencies
```
pip3 install -r requirements.txt
```
